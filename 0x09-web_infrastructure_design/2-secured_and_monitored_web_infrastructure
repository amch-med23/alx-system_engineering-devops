-- explaination to some specifics about this infrastructure:

1-What are firewalls for? firewalls are there for packet filtering, so they can allow secure outgoing requests and block insecure incoming ones and so ones.

2-Why is the traffic served over HTTPS? in HTTPS the traffic is encrypted so its secure to exchange sensible informations.

3-What monitoring is used for? we can monitor the health of our servers by monitoring the Server Temp, and active processes, the responce codes, Log analysing ...

4-How the monitoring tool is collecting data?  by streaming event logs, also called log files, that the server automatically generates. Log files contain information about errors, user activity and security events that happen on the server.

5-Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS? we can do this by following these steps:
-> Use effective monitoring tools to track the metrics relevant to the operating system environment.
-> Monitor consistently to ensure that your server is performing optimally.
-> Set up notifications and reports to alert you when your server performance falls below the established baseline or threshold alerts.

-- the issues with this infrastructure are:

1-Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue? because the traffic between the Load balancer and the web server is not encrypted, any miliscious actor can intercept the traffic and read it openelly.

2-Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue? because a miliscious actor can write invalide data to it in order to get unauthorized behaiviour from the Database server (SQL Injection).

3-Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem? i guess because this way we just west the servers petontial, and making SPOFs in each server (if any part fails). we can do better by specifying each server with a role (server dedicated to DB, other to Application, other to Load balencing, etc...)
